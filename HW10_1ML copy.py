'''Exercise 1
You have recently been hired by a major enterprise to filter out spam emails. Your man-
ager has given given you access to the following three Normal (i.e., not Spam) training emails:
train_N_I, train_N_II, train_N_III and to the following three Spam training emails: train_S_I,
train_S_II, train_S_III. Classify the following two emails: testEmail_I.txt, testEmail_II.txt as to
whether they are Normal or Spam (use NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier). Using two plots side by side,
plot the frequency of words for Normal and Spam emails
Note 1: The Prior Probability for Normal emails is: 0.73 while for Spam is: 0.27
Note 2: To open a file and place its words into a list:
with open("train_N_I.txt", "r") as f:
train_N_I = f.read().split()
Note 3: You may wish to use:
from collections import Counter
countsN = Counter(train_N_I)
to count the number of words in a file
Note 4: You may wish to use
key_listN = list(countsN.keys())
val_listN = list(countsN.values())
to get the keys/values from a dictionary and convert them to a list
Note 5: You may wish to merge the Normal emails into one file and the Spam emails into
another one'''
